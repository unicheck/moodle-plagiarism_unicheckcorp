that receive notification messages for events (FILE_UPLOAD_ERROR, etc). If this address is available only in private network,
You must open it for the following IP addresses:

#### Quiz - Essay question support.
The latest version of this plugin provides support for essay questions within the quiz activity, however Moodle **less than version 3.11** doesnâ€™t provide a way for you to view the score/report.
To allow the report to be viewed you must add a patch to the core Moodle code-base. 
More information on this is in the Moodle Tracker: MDL-32226
For a direct link to the patch required see: https://github.com/moodle/moodle/commit/dfe73fadfcf0bae603aa58707e48182a221eea5a
