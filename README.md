#### Requirements

 - Unicheck plugin requires Moodle cron to be properly configured. See [documentation](https://docs.moodle.org/33/en/Cron).
 We recommend scheduling cron as often as possible (more often than once per hour).

 - For supporting RAR archives you have to install php-ext using command
`pecl install rar`. Find more info on [php.net](http://php.net/manual/en/rar.installation.php).

 - We use URL `https://<moodle_server_domain>/plagiarism/unicheck/callback.php?token={token}>` as listener for HTTP callbacks
that receive notification messages for events (FILE_UPLOAD_ERROR, etc). If this address is available only in private network,
you must open it for the network _5.39.49.208/28_
